# FloRA verification checkpoint — 2026-10-02

## Completed refined observation: independent seal traversal is costly

[Four-tag diagnostic 37073820659](https://github.com/NIne-WIngEd/FloRA/actions/runs/37073820659)
finished collection at 22:45:56 UTC. The fixture **failed**, qualification is
false, and the original 60,000 ms response budget remains. The
[original numeric artifact](evidence/2026-10-02_d0f90655_native_profile.json)
is byte-identical; [validation](evidence/2026-10-02_d0f90655_native_profile_validation.json)
matches all 116 after-source files (60 FloRA `d0f90655`, 56 Alice `4f287a`)
and all 115 before files. Job logs confirm both checkouts and workers-only mode.

Six owned jobs used one ledger, 121.014 s wall / 106.410 s thread CPU. Two
preparation calls total 119.080 s inclusive wall / 105.249 s CPU. No worker
window capped, no observer error/overflow/hook change occurred, and no active
or open span remained at close. Parent setup remains unobserved. Added tags
change sampling overhead; this is attribution within the new observation,
not a speedup comparison to earlier scopes.

| Original-code tag | Calls | Exclusive CPU seconds | Inclusive CPU seconds |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| phase.descriptor_tree_verify | 3,469 | 2.424 | 35.861 |
| phase.descriptor_contracts | 20,451 | 2.341 | 2.341 |
| phase.origin_seal_verify | 10,063 | 21.670 | 21.670 |
| shared.frame.contracts | 9,908 | 1.507 | 2.649 |
| shared.frame.context_binding_verify | 245,532 | 13.555 | 30.056 |

The new tags distinguish **origin seal traversal** from the cheaper module
contract scans. `_verify_origin_seal` independently checks each registered
origin's identity, reader identities and recursively captured function-binding
seals for every descriptor/parent. The earlier origin-body de-duplication
deliberately retained all those seals. This evidence does not justify skipping
them or caching a successful authority answer. Context binding verification
also remains material. Inclusive tree/binding totals contain nested work and
must not be added to their child totals.

The next design question is how to represent exact immutable origin dependency
bindings once while still checking every descriptor's private issuance and
independent seal relation, then rechecking after callbacks and at each new
protected boundary. Establish that representation and mutation/replacement
tests before changing runtime. Keep current physical reobservation, independent
controllers and terminal fences. Ordinary CI for `da370ebc`/`d0f90655` is still
the separate gate; no further runtime change is made at this checkpoint.

## Current continuation: bounded contract-cost observation

Observation source `d0f906550ca36a35903702a205d263a8b1b21061`, tree
`a24132ef82b59f972ca5398e4ab0928079d147a6`, adds exactly four fixed original
code tags: `phase.descriptor_tree_verify`, `phase.descriptor_contracts`,
`phase.origin_seal_verify`, and `shared.frame.contracts`. Runtime and its four
candidate source/test hashes stay identical to `da370ebc`. Every old tag,
worker/default-mode semantic, numeric-only privacy rule and budget remains.
No native function is wrapped or replaced.

All **32 observer contracts passed in 3.493 s** on native Linux/ARM64, including
the existing 31 and a controlled-thread regression that excludes an equal
copied code object while counting the original target once. The
[source-pinned receipt](evidence/2026-10-02_d0f90655_observer_contracts.json)
separates these observer tests from the 72 passed runtime contracts and the
failed `da370ebc` engine fixture. Added sampling changes observation overhead;
compare reached stages and attribution, not equal-overhead speedups.

The existing push filter launched
[diagnostic 37073820659](https://github.com/NIne-WIngEd/FloRA/actions/runs/37073820659)
once. [PR CI 37073825647](https://github.com/NIne-WIngEd/FloRA/actions/runs/37073825647)
and push CI 37073820636 are also pending. Recover their exact checkouts and
artifacts next; no current response pass is claimed. When only runs remain,
stop the turn and resume when the owner returns.

## Completed candidate observation — no response qualification

[Native diagnostic 37072026458](https://github.com/NIne-WIngEd/FloRA/actions/runs/37072026458)
completed collection at 22:25:33 UTC, but the exact fixture **failed** and
qualification remains false. The [original artifact](evidence/2026-10-02_da370ebc_native_profile.json)
is retained byte-for-byte. [Validation](evidence/2026-10-02_da370ebc_native_profile_validation.json)
matches all 116 after-source hashes (60 FloRA `da370ebc`, 56 Alice `4f287a`),
all 115 before hashes, and the sole newly loaded authenticated-history module.
Job logs confirm both checkouts and `--workers-only --cap-seconds 180`.
File hashes and separately bound original code identities remain distinct.

Both observations have six owned jobs on one ledger. Neither reached the
180 s worker cutoff, changed hooks, overflowed, recorded observer errors or
left active/open spans at close. Parent setup and CPU remain unobserved.

| Observed quantity | bf597366 | da370ebc |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Worker wall seconds | 121.382 | 120.902 |
| Worker thread CPU seconds | 110.109 | 109.280 |
| Two preparation calls, inclusive wall seconds | 118.229 | 119.398 |
| Two preparation calls, inclusive CPU seconds | 108.083 | 108.309 |
| Frames created | 8 | 17 |
| Kurrent reads / SQL executes | 870 / 9,180 | 2,261 / 23,836 |
| Origin-body calls / exclusive CPU seconds | 5,436 / 21.012 | 4,201 / 8.045 |

More frame/RPC progress occurred before unchanged deadlines, so these are
different work mixes, not equal-work speedup measurements. Whole elapsed fell
from 247.910 s to 182.645 s while first owned entry moved from 126.165 s to
61.569 s; unobserved setup prevents attributing that difference to the candidate.
Public descriptor calls fell from 5,434 to 292, but private pair/tree traversal
moved their remaining cost into `base_bindings`, whose exclusive CPU was
29.698 s. Context binding checks ran 297,586 times at 14.207 s exclusive CPU.
These are overlapping stages' exclusive measurements, not connection counts.

The [read-only review](evidence/2026-10-02_da370ebc_native_profile_review.json)
localizes the remaining reached stage to context preparation/assembly and
current-authority frame work. Native authorization and lineage tags remain
zero; downstream generation was not measured. Four additional fixed original
code tags are the bounded next observation: descriptor tree, descriptor
contract scan, origin seal and frame contract scan. They add observation
overhead and must not be treated as identical old measurement coverage. No
further runtime rewrite is supported yet. Ordinary CI for `da370ebc` remains
the independent response/correctness gate under unchanged clocks.

## Published measured-origin candidate

Runtime `da370ebc9b089aec430859059cc83af52e623089`, tree
`5a904dbd310814bf5dbeeaac8832dc4fc53d573c`, applies the smallest measured
dependency change in [draft PR #1](https://github.com/NIne-WIngEd/FloRA/pull/1).
One fresh descriptor-tree pass verifies each exact native origin body once.
Every root and inherited parent still checks its own private issuance, class,
token, descriptor/gate/reader/origin seals and installed gate owner. The local
identity map holds exact objects and ends before returning to frame callbacks;
later checks start fresh. This is pure dependency work, with no saved permission
answer, source-head result or cross-boundary proof.

The [source-pinned component receipt](evidence/2026-10-02_da370ebc_origin_contracts.json)
records **52 focused passes** on native Linux/ARM64: phase 25 in 3.573 s, H 19
in 2.656 s and consumer/frame 8 in 64.170 s. The first consumer run had seven
passes and one test-placement failure: the prepared wrapper rejected changed
scope before the intended origin assertion. The corrected test mutates scope
inside the real frame callback and requires origin-specific rejection. Runtime
bytes stayed unchanged. The separate original frame suite then passed **20/20
in 823.111 s** (827.967 s process) at 22:32:20 UTC, with runtime/test hashes
unchanged. Total current targeted coverage is **72 passes**. These component
timings do not establish response latency or a controlled speedup over old runs.

[Ordinary PR CI 37072008699](https://github.com/NIne-WIngEd/FloRA/actions/runs/37072008699),
push CI 37072002344 and the once-dispatched
[engine diagnostic 37072026458](https://github.com/NIne-WIngEd/FloRA/actions/runs/37072026458)
were pending at publication. The completed diagnostic is recorded above;
ordinary CI remains pending. Component passes do not inherit older physical
results or establish response improvement. The original 10,000 ms standalone,
60,000 ms native and 60-minute CI limits remain. No learned model is run.

The observer is unchanged: private pair traversal now appears within
`shared.frame.base_bindings` instead of calling the public
`phase.descriptor_verify` entry. A drop in that entry's count or CPU alone cannot
show removed cost. Compare whole observed worker/preparation CPU and wall,
original origin-body counts, reached stages and overlapping fixed-tag spans.
Retain setup coverage limits and observation overhead.

The necessary Alice-aligned loop remains source Experience → external proposal
→ deterministic Claim admission → governed current state → exact context →
native judgment/decision → linked outcome → externally proposed successor →
separate activation. [The middle-layer audit](ALICE_MIDDLE_LAYER_DESIGN_AUDIT_2026-10-02.md)
binds that loop to Alice's architecture and revised comic. The remaining full-H
reconstruction, H×C evaluation and lineage/context reconstruction are measured
follow-up candidates, not permission to add a full mission platform or skip
authority. Personality and MFM remain external integration inputs.

## Completed worker-repair CI at 9b57ed3

Both earlier ordinary runs completed with failure at 22:15 UTC:
[PR 37065697026](https://github.com/NIne-WIngEd/FloRA/actions/runs/37065697026)
and push 37065691025. Each passed **947 component tests in 78 modules**.
Physical results are **49 passed, two failed and two incomplete of 53**,
including one explicit history coordinator pass before cancellation. History
preregistration and retained history remain incomplete. PR merge `6eb543a6`
has the exact published `9b57ed3` tree `9541734d`; Alice is pinned at `4f287a`.

Standalone BEFORE/AFTER were **14,707 / 21,102 ms** in PR CI and
**23,956 / 38,911 ms** in push CI, all above 10,000 ms. Native attempts were
**60,071 / 60,132 ms** and **60,108 / 60,134 ms** respectively, all timeout
under 60,000 ms. The [completed exact-source receipts](evidence/2026-10-02_9b57ed3_completed_ci_receipts.json)
retain per-job summaries and cancellation progress. Component correctness
does not qualify those responses; these outcomes apply to 9b57ed3, not the
current candidate. Pending references to these runs below are historical.

## Measured owned work at bf597366

[Native diagnostic 37068588428](https://github.com/NIne-WIngEd/FloRA/actions/runs/37068588428)
completed at 21:49:45UTC. Its [artifact](evidence/2026-10-02_bf597366_native_profile.json)
records a failed fixture and qualification=false. The corrected scope reached
six original owned jobs on one worker ledger:121.382s wall/110.109s thread CPU,
with first entry126.165s after observation started and 247.910s total elapsed.
Parent/setup timing is unobserved; no worker window capped and no hook change,
overflow, observer error or open span remained at close. Return events include
exception unwind and never certify authority success.

The [source validation](evidence/2026-10-02_bf597366_native_profile_validation.json)
matches all 116 loaded after-source file hashes to pinned Git blobs:60 FloRA
atbf597366 and 56 Alice at 4f287a. All115 before-source hashes are unchanged;
newly loaded authenticated_history also matches. These are file hashes, not
compiled-code attestation; fixed targets separately bind original code identities.
The job logs confirm both exact checkouts and the explicit workers-only command.

| Original-code tag | Calls | Exclusive thread CPU | Inclusive thread CPU |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| phase.descriptor_verify |5,434|23.257s|64.947s|
| phase.origin_verify |5,436|21.012s|22.940s|
| phase.function_binding_verify |93,790|5.359s|12.149s|
| shared.frame.context_binding_verify |132,111|12.831s|27.865s|
| shared.frame.base_bindings |2,948|4.962s|64.809s|
| context.prepare_current |2|0.268s|108.083s|

The first four exclusive tagged totals sum62.459s, about56.7% of this observed
worker CPU window. They include untargeted work within those spans and observer
overhead. Inclusive spans overlap and must not be added. This localizes pure
verification work; it does not predict an equivalent response speedup.
Kurrent recorded 870reads, SQL 9,180executes; these are not connection-open counts.
Preparation alone accounts for118.229s inclusive wall across two calls. Later
authorization/lineage stages were not reached in this fixture, which uses
controlled recovered producer receipts rather than learned inference.

This supports testing the audit's narrow exact-origin de-duplication within
one pure descriptor traversal. Every descriptor seal remains independent;
tracking ends before callbacks and later checks start fresh. Removing repeated
origin bodies cannot remove all descriptor, seal, binding, H/C or context work.
No serving improvement,60-second pass or learned result is claimed. The original
standalone10,000ms/native60,000ms response and 60-minute CI limits still govern.
Current ordinary CI remains pending; the candidate's source and controlled
results must be recorded separately before publishing a runtime claim.

## Preserved recovery and observation checkpoint

The repaired frame's ordinary [run 37054784829](https://github.com/NIne-WIngEd/FloRA/actions/runs/37054784829)
completed with failure at 20:32:57 UTC. Runtime `ef9c190e` and merge checkout
`2f166a9d` share exact tree `1f9b9558`; all 944 component tests in 78 modules
passed, including H 19, frame 20 and the original worker 11. Physical results
are **49 passed, two failed and two incomplete out of 53**. Standalone
BEFORE/AFTER attempts were 25,743 / 40,144 ms against 10,000 ms; native attempts
were 60,061 / 60,108 ms against 60,000 ms. History preregistration and retained
history did not finish. The [completed receipt](evidence/2026-10-02_ef9c190e_completed_ci_receipts.json)
supersedes pending observations below; earlier failures remain historical evidence.

The separate local worker failures were reproduced. A child exiting before
input dispatch could raise `ConnectionResetError` while awaiting stdin closure,
hiding its exit status; cancellation could cancel the protocol-owned close
future. Runtime `9b57ed3ce0d634409c967983bd5878ff74b48d3b`, tree
`9541734db403ed1931c974a7e2a1bdab0e2b9c1e`, applies Python's subprocess
stdin handling and adds process regressions. Its unchanged-source local rerun
passed 13/13 worker tests in 1.972 s; fixed-tag profiler contracts passed 21/21
in 6.388 s on native ARM64. The first worker run's deadline-fixture error and
remaining transport warnings are preserved in the [component receipt](evidence/2026-10-02_9b57ed3_worker_profile_contracts.json).
This resolves the confirmed input race; it does not establish cleanup or latency
qualification. The new [ordinary PR run](https://github.com/NIne-WIngEd/FloRA/actions/runs/37065697026)
remains pending at this checkpoint and inherits none of the older CI results.

The [actual-engine diagnostic 37065691146](https://github.com/NIne-WIngEd/FloRA/actions/runs/37065691146)
completed its workflow, but its [artifact](evidence/2026-10-02_9b57ed3_native_profile_setup_cap.json)
is **capped, qualification false**: 180.013 s, zero owned-work entries and zero
worker ledgers. Parent setup recorded 2,673 Kurrent reads and 35,577 SQL executes;
those are statements/RPCs, not connection-open counts. Non-RPC setup was
unobserved. It never reached the fresh-frame native path, so no frame-cost or
response attribution is justified. An all-call local diagnostic was also
stopped incomplete without usable stage timings; its interruption stack is
not quantitative evidence.

The owner's clarification means comparable systems and their open implementations,
not a request to name a benchmark provider. [Pinned primary research](LATENCY_RESEARCH_2026-10-02.md)
covers Graphify, Graphiti, Mem0, Letta, SpiceDB and Alice's research branches.
The useful hypothesis is reuse of exact immutable dependency work inside one
fresh boundary. First measure the remaining duplicated work; keep independent
authority callbacks, physical reobservation and the terminal joint row fence.
No cached positive authority or full memory/mission platform is proposed.

The observation update is published at `bf59736673d4f054ff85636ca80a1983d14d7cd5`,
tree `58510702886b9915c84305e070fec9fe24a5b8fd`. All 31 controlled profiler
contracts passed in 4.990 s on native ARM64; the original 21 and default cap
semantics remain. The [source-pinned receipt](evidence/2026-10-02_bf597366_owned_observer_contracts.json)
records the separate worker windows and review. The workflow explicitly uses
`--workers-only`: parent setup stays unprofiled, each worker gets one bounded
180-second observation window from its first original owned entry, and cutoff
never cancels the worker or fabricates a CPU sample. Response and CI clocks
are unchanged. Four original-code tags expose descriptor/origin/function-binding
work. [Actual-engine diagnostic 37068588428](https://github.com/NIne-WIngEd/FloRA/actions/runs/37068588428)
and [ordinary PR CI 37068593649](https://github.com/NIne-WIngEd/FloRA/actions/runs/37068593649)
are pending; no observed speedup or new full gate is claimed.

The owner's latest reminder also makes middle-layer design alignment explicit.
The [source audit](ALICE_MIDDLE_LAYER_DESIGN_AUDIT_2026-10-02.md) compares the
implemented experience/Claim/state/judgment/outcome links with Alice's original
docs and revised comic. Current roles are connected and aligned; a full mission
subsystem is absent and not required by this case. Concrete repeated history
authentication, H-per-C evaluation and native-origin verifier traversal remain.
Their response cost still needs measurement. The smallest proposed next change
is call-local de-duplication of the same native origin during one pure descriptor
validation pass, retaining every descriptor seal and fresh live boundary. This
is a conditional implementation proposal, not an implemented Alice mechanism
or cached authorization. Personality and MFM remain external.

Kaggle and Magnolia remain preferred for eligible compute; Hugging Face and
local PC Docker are also available. Paid GPU hours remain the last fallback.
Docker has been used for native CPU contracts; no GPU or model work was launched.
Personality and MFM are built in the other chats and will be plugged in here.
When only a run is pending and no independent work remains, end the turn and
resume when the owner returns; do not spend tokens polling unchanged jobs.

## Preserved recovered baseline

Repository baseline: `main@885be57abb582510d27a98177facd2a358c11387`.
Last runtime publication:
`74f42417be37a2fbdc6c603a1ea657b040e0052e`.
The [October 1 checkpoint](VERIFICATION_CHECKPOINT_2026-10-01.md) preserves
earlier evidence. This receipt updates its stale pending status; no earlier
failure is removed.

The owner's October 2 instruction narrows FloRA to the experiment's necessary
Alice-aligned slice. [FLORA_CONTEXT.md](FLORA_CONTEXT.md) records current scope,
the previous continuation and [Alice's connected ledger design](ALICE_INFRASTRUCTURE_MAP.md).
Documentation changes establish no runtime or behavioral qualification.

The owner's latest October 2 compute instruction prefers available Kaggle and
Magnolia for later eligible external-artifact or integration workloads, with
paid GPU hours only as the last fallback if those options fail. Current CPU
contract validation requires no GPU, and no GPU work is being launched now.
Personality and MFM remain in other chats. Provider details, quotas and new
infrastructure are not inferred.

## Completed ordinary CI at 74f42417

[Run 36828262948](https://github.com/NIne-WIngEd/FloRA/actions/runs/36828262948)
started at 2026-10-01 07:04:41 UTC and has **completed with failure**.
Its 13 jobs were read through current GitHub job records and decoded logs.
Compact safe case summaries and exact job links are preserved in
[the completed receipt](evidence/2026-10-02_74f42417_completed_ci_receipts.json).
No new workflow or diagnostic was dispatched to obtain this receipt.

| Job group | Completed observation |
| --- | --- |
| Contracts | 884 tests in 75 modules passed, including all 18 phase-origin descriptor tests |
| Core | All 38 physical cases passed; the job's existing authority and persistent Temporal restart steps also succeeded |
| Transport | 1/2 cases passed; standalone response BEFORE 17,471 ms and AFTER 28,082 ms exceeded the unchanged 10,000 ms limit |
| Native comparison | 0/1 passed; BEFORE 60,072 ms and AFTER 60,142 ms timed out against 60,000 ms; complete case duration 199.182 s |
| Native pilot before-tail | 1/1 passed, 2,150.790 s fixture duration |
| Native pilot outcome-audit | 1/1 passed, 1,547.685 s fixture duration |
| Native pilot typed-phase | 1/1 passed, 3,261.212 s fixture duration |
| Native pilot withdrawal | 1/1 passed, 139.256 s fixture duration |
| Lineage | 2/2 passed, 1,768.615 s total fixture duration |
| Guarded readers/writer faults | 2/2 passed, 101.812 s total fixture duration |
| History | Coordinator case passed, 106.223 s. Preregistration registered originals in 101.266 s, but its case did not complete before the one-hour job cap |
| Retained history routes | No completed case before the unchanged one-hour job cap |
| Native history routes | 1/1 passed, 2,167.184 s fixture duration |

That is **49/53 physical cases passed**, **two failed response budgets**, and
**two incomplete cases**. Fixture durations include work outside an ordinary
response and are not consumer latency. A green descriptor/correctness case
does not qualify the failed response path.

The descriptor implementation makes no check bypass or proof-sharing change.
At that source the shared serving frame remained pending; the prior CI confirms no latency
improvement. Models, learned behavior, real-host benefit and FBM transfer remain
unqualified.

## This continuation

The context and build map now explicitly separate the narrow prototype from
the complete product. Scope is preserved in a root continuation guide and a
source-pinned ledger/mission map. Existing useful components remain inventory;
completing every full-product lane is not a prerequisite.

The [shared source metadata collector](SHARED_SOURCE_METADATA_CAPS.md) now
extends the existing same-call nomination helper with separate source-DAG caps,
including overlapping domains with the same purpose. Existing pair callers
keep their behavior; at collector publication no triple caller or shared
serving frame was activated.
Raw-only dependencies invent no grants. The future H contributor must still
account for its physical manifest independently.

Testing exposed an existing classifier defect: replacing a reader on its class
could cause batching to skip that callback. Original reader identity/code and
the exact native owner are now required for batching. Custom readers run the
fallback, including fresh second-pass source/raw callbacks.

**90 controlled contract tests in five modules passed** on Windows/Python
3.12.14 with Alice API pin `4f287a48`: 21 shared-source metadata, 14 phase-source
fence, 25 history fence, 24 selected-history fence and 6 combined-purpose tests.
An independent reviewer reran all 21 new tests and verified the frozen source
hashes. Summed suite duration 28.614 s is test execution time, not response
latency. The [exact local receipt](evidence/2026-10-02_shared_source_caps_local_contracts.json)
preserves the test selection, source identity and failures/repairs.

The tested source was published at
`3a6e03cfeb2207a88f555c1fa88d10aad5bd987b` on
`codex/flora-shared-source-caps`, in
[draft PR #1](https://github.com/NIne-WIngEd/FloRA/pull/1).
Ordinary [run 37041602495](https://github.com/NIne-WIngEd/FloRA/actions/runs/37041602495)
checks merge commit `1573eeb47bf804ae7b06b98ffbe0472f04b57d5a`, whose complete
tree exactly matches that development commit. At 2026-10-02 17:40:19 UTC the
run remained in progress: guarded readers/writer faults passed 2/2 physical
cases and native pilot withdrawal passed its one case. Contracts and other
physical jobs were still pending completion. This partial observation is not
a completed same-commit gate, latency pass or behavioral result. Inspect the
run before replacing pending status with a completed receipt.

A [later partial observation](evidence/2026-10-02_3a6e03cf_partial_ci_receipts.json)
at 17:44:50 UTC records the completed response failures: standalone BEFORE
24,377 ms and AFTER 39,477 ms exceed 10,000 ms; native BEFORE 60,074 ms and
AFTER 60,141 ms time out against 60,000 ms. Reader and withdrawal cases remain
passed. Contracts and eight other physical jobs were still running. This helper
does not activate the serving optimization; response latency remains unresolved.

The two preregistration modules import Unix-only `fcntl` through the existing
native worker and could not execute locally; no compatibility shim was used.
The ordinary Linux gate remains required. No local physical engines were run.
At collector publication, shared initial-assembly and H/C/Claim/state frame
integration, actual-engine response qualification, learned judgment and builder
transfer remained pending.

The public procedure ledger now has 97 schema-valid seeds. They describe
construction methods, not qualified FBM training cases or runtime personal
memory. Documentation and the helper establish no broader experimental pass.

## Completed collector CI at 3a6e03cf

The ordinary collector-only
[run 37041602495](https://github.com/NIne-WIngEd/FloRA/actions/runs/37041602495)
completed at 18:34:41 UTC with failure. Its
[completed receipt](evidence/2026-10-02_3a6e03cf_completed_ci_receipts.json)
supersedes the earlier partial observations above, while retaining them as
historical records. All 905 component cases in 76 modules passed; 50 of 53
physical cases passed, two response cases failed, and one history
preregistration case remained incomplete at the unchanged 60-minute cap.
The retained-history route completed this time.

These results belong to runtime
`3a6e03cfeb2207a88f555c1fa88d10aad5bd987b` and checkout
`1573eeb47bf804ae7b06b98ffbe0472f04b57d5a`, whose identical complete tree is
`a2ad365699f9c328635bf39acbcbf8019ac6152a`. They precede fresh-frame activation.
Standalone BEFORE/AFTER responses were 24,377 / 39,477 ms against 10,000 ms;
native responses timed out at 60,074 / 60,141 ms against 60,000 ms. Passing
contracts and more completed fixtures do not qualify these failed budgets.

## Fresh shared authority frame at 36f39b36 — failed candidate

The owner authorized integration of the fresh frame within FloRA's existing
narrow experimental slice. The development change now joins held-history H,
selected context C, current/immutable Claims and governed-state metadata in one
protected-boundary terminal observation. The
[updated protocol](SELECTED_AUTHORITY_FRAME_PROTOCOL.md) records the precise
ownership, separate caps and final ordering.

The runtime is published at
`36f39b36d3101a6af4e785fb60d382234db6409f`, tree
`3ef7a298432d81a08923e264ae36e95a0df9fb72`, on
`codex/flora-shared-source-caps` in
[draft PR #1](https://github.com/NIne-WIngEd/FloRA/pull/1).
Ordinary [run 37049792243](https://github.com/NIne-WIngEd/FloRA/actions/runs/37049792243)
is now in progress. The guarded reader job has passed. Native comparison
failed its one case: BEFORE 60,087 ms and AFTER 60,155 ms exceeded the unchanged
60,000 ms budget; the complete case duration was 212.594 s. This partial
observation preserves the response failure and is not a completed full gate.
Its actual checkout tree and remaining completed test results
must be verified before assigning exact-source correctness or physical
qualification. There is no completed full-runtime receipt yet.

New source files are `src/flora/selected/selected_authority_frame.py` and
`src/flora/selected/selected_history_contribution.py`. The context consumer
integrates them in `context_guard.py` and preflights dual issuance in
`selected_context.py`. Test additions are `test_shared_authority_frame.py` and
`test_selected_history_contribution.py`. All six published source/test hashes
were independently read before the pending opaque-guard repair:

A native Linux/ARM64 final-source runner began at **18:54:22 UTC** against
`36f39b36`, checking all six hashes above at startup. It runs all **78 contract
modules in separate processes**, matching ordinary CI's isolation, and
prioritizes the two new modules. The runner uses image
`bbb524290db6a69edc7479eec6ee6a2d2b9946d5c0be0af86eb948575b5379e2`,
Python 3.12.15 and GLIBC 2.41 with the exact pinned dependencies. Imports,
including native `fcntl`, succeeded without a shim. The H contributor module
passed **19 controlled tests in 4.535 s**. The frame module then finished in
**930.594 s with 17/19 cases passing and two failures** at this exact source.
`test_final_callback_withdraws_selected_context_source` and
`test_final_callback_withdraws_unselected_history_evaluation_source` both
expected two independent guard calls but observed one. This is a failed
controlled frame gate, not a completed final-runtime pass.
The [source-pinned failure receipt](evidence/2026-10-02_36f39b36_frame_contract_failure.json)
preserves native environment, six hashes, exact assertion values and timings.
This runner completed only two of its 78 planned modules before the failure:
36/38 cases passed overall, including 19 H and 17 frame cases. Its complete
runner duration was 943.478 s; module/process/runner timings are distinct.

The failure is premature binding refusal: recursive `_FunctionBinding`
capture descended into the opaque external phase guard and froze its
closed-over counter. Its first legitimate call changed that state while the
guard's identity and code stayed fixed. The frame then rejected before the
required second callback. The pending repair limits recursive closure capture
to known pure context binding helpers, while separately retaining external
function identity/code and actual independent calls. Tests and response
budgets remain unchanged. The repaired source identity and its verification
are pending; this failed source and receipt must remain visible.

A local `_capture_context_binding` repair now limits that recursive capture
to known pure context helper closures. The two formerly failing selected C
and unselected H final-callback tests passed **2/2 in 68.205 s** on native
Linux/ARM64 with unchanged assertions. This is progress on an unpublished
local repair, whose final source receipt remains pending. The complete
19-case frame suite and new ordinary CI remain required; this subset does not
qualify the frame, physical correctness or response latency.

The earlier Linux/amd64 QEMU contributor selection passed 19 tests in 26.478 s.
Its frame and selected-context selections against candidate
`876e4177c8b67edea525b138620fbe0907c2cd72` were stopped incomplete after being
superseded by the final-source native runner. Candidate ordinary runs
[37049045405](https://github.com/NIne-WIngEd/FloRA/actions/runs/37049045405) and
[37049038903](https://github.com/NIne-WIngEd/FloRA/actions/runs/37049038903)
were intentionally canceled to free current CI slots. They are not new
qualification. The published follow-up changes only the frame's module/class
alias identity pins. An earlier exploratory full metadata case passed in
253.115 s before the final seals; it is not a final-source receipt. These are
controlled fixture durations, not response latency. The ordinary
published-source CI remains required.

The frame keeps `sample.permissions` and `state.policy` attached to the actual
gated runtime owner. Local copied predicates share native sampled material;
independent external callbacks and signed owner/qualification mechanisms must
remain live, including legitimate opaque guard state. H includes its custody
manifest under its own cap and every evaluation
grant, even for originals absent from C. C and each phase ancestry keep their
separate limits. Private reads keep four fresh checks; initial qualification
and assembly byte boundaries also construct new frames. A final physical pass
and joint XTDB observation follow the actual callbacks; only pure sealed
identity/native-value checks run afterward.

Original-service `assemble_context` traversal and opaque independent guards
remain intact and can still repeat history work. Immutable Claim/state row
sampling can also repeat within a frame. No connection pool, new memory ledger,
request-wide positive authority cache, full Alice infrastructure, personality
model or MFM is introduced. These are explicit remaining costs, not evidence
that response budgets have passed.

The new public method seed is
[the fresh-frame construction record](fbm-seeds/2026-10-02_fresh_shared_authority_frame.jsonl).
The [linked opaque-guard failure/repair record](fbm-seeds/2026-10-02_fresh_frame_opaque_guard_repair.jsonl)
preserves this failed 17/19 selection. The
[two-case repair progress seed](fbm-seeds/2026-10-02_opaque_guard_repair_subset.jsonl)
records the narrow passing subset without full qualification. All 101 procedure records pass the
existing shape validator, and the three
FBM-seed contract tests pass. The full implementation receipt remains pending.
The record is a procedure seed, not runtime personal memory,
a linked eligible FBM training case, a learned result or a transfer result.
The prior completed physical failures above remain authoritative
for their exact earlier sources. No complete physical gate, response-latency
or learned pass is claimed here.

## Preserved ef9c190e partial checkpoint at 19:38 UTC

Published runtime `ef9c190e0688c2bb06dce5b12bbef06e6bd4f13f` has tree
`1f9b955849cbc69ed1f0244366876bbe672fd0c6`. Pure context closures remain
recursively sealed; native immutable guard-code pairs separately bind opaque
function identity/code while permitting legitimate internal state changes.
The two final withdrawal tests passed 2/2 in 73.007 s on native Linux/ARM64;
the new opaque guard code-swap test passed 1/1 in 10.439 s. Earlier 68.205 s
progress belongs to source fingerprint `82c784b`, before final code pins.
The failed `36f39b36` frame receipt remains preserved above.

The 20-case frame suite and separate 76-existing-module selection began at
19:32:58 UTC on native Linux/ARM64, using the same pinned image/dependencies
recorded above. The frame suite is still pending. The existing-module runner
halted at **19:37:32 UTC** after **35/76 modules** and **478 cases: 476 passed,
one failed, one errored**. Forty-one modules were not run. Its
[safe source-pinned receipt](evidence/2026-10-02_ef9c190e_existing_contract_failure.json)
preserves all module counts and fixed diagnostics without fixture content.

`test_native_worker.py` ran 11 cases in 1.765 s: nine passed, one failed and
one errored. `test_output_cap_and_exit_failure_have_safe_receipts` expected
`exit_failure` but received `worker_rejected`;
`test_stderr_limit_and_no_inherited_environment` raised
`NativeWorkerFailure: worker_rejected`. `asyncio.InvalidStateError` and
transport resource warnings also appeared. Worker code/tests are unchanged,
but the cause is **unresolved**; neither an environment-only cause nor a frame
regression is established. The broad local gate failed and requires
investigation, not a full-pass claim.

Ordinary [run 37054784829](https://github.com/NIne-WIngEd/FloRA/actions/runs/37054784829)
checks merge `2f166a9d745667b200302a404bd04f8def7a83d9`, whose complete tree
exactly matches the published runtime. At **19:38:11 UTC**, its
[partial receipt](evidence/2026-10-02_ef9c190e_partial_ci_receipts.json) records
readers 2/2 and withdrawal 1/1 passing; native comparison failed at
60,061 / 60,108 ms against the unchanged 60,000 ms budget. Three of 53
physical cases passed, one failed, and 49 remained pending. Component
contracts, transport and other jobs had no completed full receipt. No
standalone response measurement is inferred while transport remains pending.

At that earlier checkpoint the native frame and broader local JSON receipts
and ordinary CI were still pending collection. Their completed outcomes and
the independently reproduced worker repair are now recorded above. The old
tool sessions are no longer a next-step requirement. Preserve the failed broad
local receipt and the exact-source later CI rather than inventing results for
the 41 modules not run locally.

The linked [final code-pin progress seed](fbm-seeds/2026-10-02_opaque_guard_code_pin_progress.jsonl)
records these source distinctions and partial outcomes. All 101 method seeds
are schema-valid, and the three FBM contract tests pass. Method seeds remain
procedure-only records, not qualified training cases. Physical correctness,
response latency, learned judgment and FBM transfer remain unqualified.

The owner's latest direction is to measure the remaining latency cause before
another serving change, use the existing research branches/plugins and
Graphify where useful, and consult relevant frontier/competing-system primary
research and open-source implementations. Record the applicable mechanism and
predicted effect, then test it against the same physical clocks and authority
contracts. This is a next-step requirement, not a completed research receipt.

## Completed repaired frame module, 19:48:46 UTC

The exact-source native Linux/ARM64 frame selection completed **20/20 tests
passing in 944.073 s**, process duration 947.728 s. Its
[receipt](evidence/2026-10-02_ef9c190e_frame_contract_pass.json) preserves
`ef9c190e`, Alice `4f287a48`, all six startup hashes and the environment.
This supersedes the pending frame status in the earlier partial checkpoint.
The final code-swap regression and both original withdrawal assertions are
included. The old failed 17/19 selection remains visible and linked.

The broader local gate still failed on the two worker issues above, with 41
modules unrun. Ordinary CI remains incomplete at the last collected snapshot,
and its native response budget has failed. Do not infer a full contract,
physical, response-latency, learned-judgment or transfer pass. The linked
completed-frame method trace adds one procedure-only record: all **102**
traces are schema-valid, and three FBM contract tests pass.
