# FloRA readiness re-audit — 2026-09-29

This is the historical starting audit. Later repairs and exact-commit engine
receipts are recorded in the [September 30 verification checkpoint](VERIFICATION_CHECKPOINT_2026-09-30.md).

**October 2 scope clarification:** preserve the findings below as a historical
audit and backlog. They are not a current requirement to finish every Alice
product surface. Follow [the current context](FLORA_CONTEXT.md), build only
what a named Flora experiment case requires, and keep its selected Alice
contracts. Personality and MFM are built in other chats and only integrated
here when ready. The current next step is the existing narrow fixture's fresh
shared authority frame and its correctness/latency gates.

**Verdict: FloRA has not exhausted the work that can proceed without the personality model and MFM. The previous model-only stopping conclusion was premature.** The selected-backend foundation is useful, but tested components are not yet a connected experiment.

This audit rechecked FloRA's source, tests and CI, the live A.L.I.C.E. architecture and relevant model/builder branches, Fable Sleight's live product documents, and the five uploaded source-chat PDFs. No personality substitute, MFM substitute, new judgment model, or behavioral win was introduced.

## What FloRA is proving

- Part one: reuse the actual personality model and MFM, alongside selected memory infrastructure, to test whether a correction or outcome changes later native personal judgment for the right reason. Unrelated judgments should remain stable.
- Compare against a competent general model with memory under equal authorized history and comparable budgets. Use a same-evidence ablation to separate retrieval benefits from personal judgment updating.
- Part two starts after the first claim succeeds: a small FBM builds the same qualified slice for other isolated hosts. A hand-configured second host does not prove the builder.
- Synthetic histories establish mechanism evidence. Blind assessment with consenting real hosts establishes a different kind of evidence. Neither is presently demonstrated.
- A narrow internal experiment is permitted. It must preserve the selected roles and engines of the capabilities it exercises; it need not finish every consumer-v1 capability first.

The [frozen goal](EXPERIMENT_GOAL.md) remains correct. See the [experiment audit](EXPERIMENT_READINESS_AUDIT.md) for source-chat context and the missing evaluation work.

## Source and context checks

| Source | Audited ref | Consequence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| FloRA | `main@412f7bdff44ef4fc5690f7daab2be8390260885b` | Starting tree `963768ed5922e1b602fe1d3ecf4c659ffa132e9f`; local pre-audit commit has equivalent content. |
| A.L.I.C.E. selected architecture | `main@8ea804aa25c3d1c5f46e9be5810d072ed0fadb4b` | Stage G/H/I/J successor is the design source; old Phase 2 is not an implementation basis. |
| MFM | `research/mfm-foundation-20260923@4f287a488bc908bd04f99255ee01b794bacba50b` | FloRA still pins older `00583fb2`; schema 1.2 and source/planner seams require deliberate integration. |
| FBM | `fable-builder-model@803477ba290030b3ed46459a90eb15529146fff2` | Procedure traces are seeds, not qualified construction cases or builder weights. |
| Personality work | foundation `a19f8e88`; joint-DDP branch `5e29f7f6` | Read for interface/dependency context only; this audit does not qualify a model. |
| Fable Sleight | `main@1805a01c73575378246cac8cbbb72cd891e8528e` | Product thesis aligns, but execution-profile engine choices drift from A.L.I.C.E.; see architecture audit. |
| Graphify context | `research/graphify-context-substrate@a06f61ea` | Used the repository's catalog query to route to formation, identity and builder sources, then verified current originals. |

Graphify's catalog anchor matches the live historical `alice-eipm-v1-build` ref, but its branch pointers predate newer MFM/FBM work. Its code graph receipt names the older foundation commit `f357a767`, not today's foundation or joint-DDP head. That code graph was not treated as current topology. The missing newer branches and changed source pointers are retrieval freshness gaps, not evidence that the work is absent.

## What was done correctly

- Retired the earlier Phase 2-based demo implementation instead of counting its storage checks as evidence for the successor.
- Implemented actual KurrentDB, XTDB, NATS ingress, Qdrant, LadybugDB and Temporal boundaries for the exercised slice.
- Kept raw evidence, claims, candidates, decisions and approvals distinct; did not label synthetic vectors or supplied verdicts as learned capability.
- Added selected-backend checks, exact-source lineage, host isolation, correction invalidation and basic restart checks.
- Preserved the real-model reuse constraint and recorded process seeds only in FloRA.

## Work still possible before the models arrive

| Order | Required work for the narrow experiment | Present gap | What can proceed now |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Current source/formation integration | `formation_input.py` reduces every source to `historical_experience`; pinned schema lacks newer provenance fields and parent closure. | Bind the active MFM source, candidate-plane and formation-context interfaces to the selected stores. Preserve roles, speakers, subject, observed/recorded times, duplicates and parents. Never upgrade synthetic provenance into authenticated owner truth. |
| 2 | Proposal-to-authority transaction | `formation_gate.py` returns a pre-adjudication assessment; it does not commit a governed proposal. | Build independent authority/admission, conflict/correction, retry and lineage orchestration around the actual proposal contract. Qualification of learned proposal quality waits for MFM. Fictional-world authority must be explicitly scoped. |
| 3 | Governed personal development | Candidate and activation stores exist; episode lineage is rejected and rollback is absent. | Connect supported episode lineage, approved state revisions, correction/outcome interventions and rollback. A changed state may alter judgment without retraining personality weights after every event. |
| 4 | Recollection and context orchestration | Caller-supplied routes, synthetic vectors, one-hop evidence graph and count-based sufficiency. | Implement/reuse planner interfaces, current-source routing, budget enforcement, provenance closure, abstention and selected-plane adapters. Learned relevance and embedding quality still need qualified components. |
| 5 | Runnable and recoverable slice | Tests compose services manually; raw references/artifact declarations lack a durable application registry and qualified admission. Temporal restart recovery is untested. | Build host configuration, reference/lineage persistence, model-interface admission and an end-to-end runner that explicitly stops at missing models. Exercise rebuild/retry/restore and interrupted workflow recovery on selected services. |
| 6 | Evaluation infrastructure | Manifest validator and tiny public development fixture, but no serious comparator or paired runner, blind pack, scorer/report path or failure receipts. | Implement comparator, cohort generation/sealing, paired execution interfaces, blind assessment and failure-inclusive reports. Actual behavioral runs, numerical threshold calibration and final preregistration depend on pilot results. |
| 7 | Source-use and influence controls | Claim quarantine covers claim-linked readers; direct Experience-derived state/episodes remain outside a global source revocation plane. | Add revocation/influence lineage for the included experiment paths; test historical reads, derivative invalidation and recovery. This is separate from declaring complete consumer-v1 unlearning. |
| 8 | Builder preparation | Procedure seeds exist; builder construction/evaluation is absent. | Validate traces and prepare recipe, permission, artifact and transfer-case registries. Train/test the small FBM only after part one qualifies. |

Detailed sources, cross-repo drift and scope boundaries are in the [architecture audit](ARCHITECTURE_READINESS_AUDIT.md).

## Repairs during this audit

- Repaired the pilot transition so an explicitly bound before-phase decision can precede the correction/outcome. The exact source prefix is retained; undeclared, unrelated and future records are rejected. This remains a fixture-specific pilot path, not the missing general experiment runner.
- Used the actual decision-linked outcome contract for the outcome intervention, preserving synthetic provenance.
- Revised the development commute case to describe a trial after the before decision. The previous story reported an older host outcome and could not honestly be attributed to a newly recorded Fable decision. The revised case still does not establish advice-following or causal quality.
- Rejected future/expired/unknown claims on ordinary current-source/vector use. Historical valid-time reads honor present quarantine and recheck it after materialization. Direct raw-event revocation across all derivatives remains open.
- Repaired and validated required FBM procedure-seed metadata. This does not make them sufficient FBM training/evaluation cases.

These repairs address concrete defects. They do not complete the independent workflow rows above. Verification for the audit commit must be recorded separately from the earlier green build; the earlier selected-backend run [36612784548](https://github.com/NIne-WIngEd/FloRA/actions/runs/36612784548) passed at the starting SHA only.

Local verification passed 21 component test methods, including five source-use regressions, three seed-contract regressions and a Temporal local-server activity retry check. The Temporal server uses in-memory persistence, so this is not durable server-restart evidence. Seed shape validation and `git diff --check` also passed. The updated pilot regression must additionally pass on real KurrentDB in the audit commit's selected-backend CI.

### Follow-up after the audit

- [Selected-backend run 36619700275](https://github.com/NIne-WIngEd/FloRA/actions/runs/36619700275) passed at audit repair commit `96a6302c`. The audit's updated pilot sequencing and selected-backend restart probes are green.
- Work continued instead of declaring a model-only pause. The active pin is moving to MFM `4f287a48`, schema 1.2.0. The [registered formation slice](REGISTERED_FORMATION.md) persists source metadata/raw custody in XTDB, preserves actual Kurrent availability time, and reuses upstream routing, parent closure and input receipts. New backend qualification is pending; this is infrastructure integration, not learned formation.
- Persistent formation-use permissions, recoverable proposal candidates and the paired execution/report harness are being built in parallel. Admission, personal-state governance, qualified runtime artifacts and the other open rows still require follow-through.

## Actual stopping rule

Do not mark this workstream on break merely because the current component checks pass. First finish the included slice's independent wiring and evaluation infrastructure, with selected-stack failure/recovery evidence and explicit admission interfaces. The runner should reach a named missing-model boundary while preserving all earlier state and lineage.

Only then should we pause for qualified MFM formation and personality inference. Their real outputs are required for the behavioral result; successful part-one evidence is required before the learned builder transfer result. No claim of exhaustive completion is supported today.
