# FloRA

**Current scope — 2026-10-04:** FloRA is a narrow prototype, not the complete
Alice/Fable memory, experience or mission platform. Build only what its selected
experiment needs, preserving Alice's contracts and chosen engines for those
parts. Start a continuation with [the context record](docs/FLORA_CONTEXT.md)
and [Alice's infrastructure map](docs/ALICE_INFRASTRUCTURE_MAP.md).
The [current checkpoint](docs/VERIFICATION_CHECKPOINT_2026-10-03.md) records
completed c70 runs:1003 component cases pass in each; physical PR50/53 and
push49/53 pass, with response failures and incomplete history cases retained.
The complete prototype is **not ready apart from the two models**, and this is
more than latency debugging. Major evidence/state/judgment/outcome/comparison
interfaces exist, while the actual frozen-phase operation and native callback
ownership still need correction and complete synthetic pipeline acceptance.
The [build-readiness map](docs/FLORA_CONTEXT.md) separates implemented plumbing,
connected physical synthetic tests, unfinished integration, and model-dependent
evidence. Full-product inventory below is not a prototype completion checklist.
Personality/MFM remain external; supplied producer fixtures prove no learning.

An experiment for one Fable claim: after a host corrects a relevant belief or preference and a decision has an outcome, does Fable's later **native judgment** change for the right reason, while keeping its evidence trail? The experiment will compare that behavior with a strong general model plus memory, using the same available history and response budget. Then a small builder must reproduce the capability for another isolated host.

The [frozen experiment goal](docs/EXPERIMENT_GOAL.md) defines the product comparison, mechanism ablation, cross-host builder test, and evidence rules. Numerical acceptance thresholds will be preregistered before the final evaluation.

The [evaluation protocol contract](docs/EVALUATION_PROTOCOL.md) now checks equal authorized histories and budgets, the same-evidence ablation, complete paired attempts, and isolated builder transfer hosts. It holds the structure for a later preregistration; it contains no fabricated model result or frozen numerical threshold.

The [paired execution interface](docs/PAIRED_COMPARISON_RUNNER.md) freezes questions and histories, preserves failed attempts and observed budget violations, and separates blinded review material from its identity key. It consumes independently supplied inference adapters; no personality, MFM or provider client is built into it.

A [fictional multi-year pilot fixture](data/synthetic_pilot/v1.json) supplies source histories for relevant correction, irrelevant correction, and outcome cases. It prepares the harness without exposing anyone's private life or claiming a scored result.
The [pilot ingestion path](docs/EVALUATION_PROTOCOL.md) materializes each case in an isolated KurrentDB and encrypted-object scope in two phases, so the intervention is absent during the before phase.

Material build decisions and failures are captured as [FBM process seeds](docs/fbm-seeds/README.md) using the A.L.I.C.E. builder trace schema. They teach the future builder how this infrastructure was constructed; they are not trained builder weights.

**Status: infrastructure under construction.** There is no conversational demo, trained personality model, Memory Formation Model (MFM), builder, qualified behavioral result, or consumer release here yet. The personality and MFM are being developed in separate workstreams. This repository builds the other demo infrastructure and will integrate their qualified outputs when ready.

**Re-audit follow-up — 2026-09-30:** the registered MFM interfaces, governed admission and development, runtime integration, paired comparator and blinded assessment now have implementations. The remaining work is being checked through actual phase routing, native pilot transitions, cohort/builder preparation and recovery after interrupted writes. The [readiness re-audit](docs/READINESS_REAUDIT_2026-09-29.md) preserves the original findings. We have not declared a model-only waiting point.

The [October 2 verification checkpoint](docs/VERIFICATION_CHECKPOINT_2026-10-02.md) records completed CI at runtime `74f42417`: 884 contract cases in 75 modules and 49/53 physical cases passed. Standalone and native comparison failed their unchanged response budgets; two history cases hit the one-hour job limits. The [October 1](docs/VERIFICATION_CHECKPOINT_2026-10-01.md) and [September 30](docs/VERIFICATION_CHECKPOINT_2026-09-30.md) checkpoints preserve earlier receipts. Diagnostics identify repeated proof construction; they do not qualify the experiment. Fictional producer receipts exercise wiring only; real learned formation, judgment and model-update proofs still come from the other workstreams.

Current additions include [bounded native execution](docs/NATIVE_EXECUTION_BRIDGE.md), [private provider attempts](docs/PROVIDER_ATTEMPT_CUSTODY.md), [comparator transport wiring](docs/COMPARATOR_ATTEMPT_WIRING.md), [bounded local embeddings](docs/BOUNDED_LOCAL_EMBEDDINGS.md), [native pilot transitions](docs/NATIVE_PILOT_LIFECYCLE.md), [phase-specific bindings](docs/PHASE_BINDINGS.md) and [current private-read authority](docs/CURRENT_AUTHORITY_BARRIERS.md). Their documents separate implementation, mechanical tests and missing qualification.

The phase path now has [historical selected snapshots](docs/SELECTED_PHASE_SNAPSHOTS.md) and [current history](docs/CURRENT_HISTORY_FENCE.md) and [context](docs/CURRENT_CONTEXT_GUARD.md) fences. [Cohort and builder manifests](docs/EXPERIMENT_MANIFEST_CUSTODY.md) keep procedure recipes separate from qualified transfer evidence. [Bounded XTDB readers](docs/BOUNDED_XTDB_PASSIVE_READS.md) retain cancelled slots until physical reads retire. These are infrastructure boundaries awaiting the expanded physical gate; they do not supply learned model behavior.

The [registered experiment coordinator](docs/EXPERIMENT_COORDINATOR.md) connects prepared cohorts, frozen native arms, comparator custody and sealed assessment while retaining incomplete attempts. [Two-stage preregistration](docs/EXPERIMENT_PREREGISTRATION.md) now separates the declared experiment from its observed captures: freeze the protocol, capture before, authorize and record the update, capture after, then seal the complete plan before evaluation. No after checkpoint or context digest is required before it exists. Contract checks exercise this workflow; physical qualification and real producer exports remain pending.

[Current metadata fences](docs/PHASE_SOURCE_METADATA_FENCE.md) remove duplicate row reads within one guard and check the selected permission heads together after callbacks. They do not cache an allow across private reads. The response budget remains unchanged. CI runs component checks and exhaustive core, transport, native, lineage, readers, history and history-route groups in parallel; core also checks actual service and persistent Temporal restarts. Slow suites cannot hide the independent reader and writer-fault results. All groups must pass at the same commit.

## Architecture boundary

The [October 1 architecture recalibration](docs/LATENCY_ARCHITECTURE_RECALIBRATION_2026-10-01.md) confirms that a turn may select zero, one or several memory planes. The [selected source closure](docs/SELECTED_SOURCE_CLOSURE.md) adds exact event lookup and bounded parent resolution with live source-use checks. [Selected context and history consumers](docs/SELECTED_CONTEXT_AND_HISTORY.md) explicitly opt into that direction while keeping current authority and private-read barriers. Whole-stream consumers remain the default; response latency still requires ordinary real-engine qualification. The [authority-frame protocol](docs/SELECTED_AUTHORITY_FRAME_PROTOCOL.md) defines the next step: share proof material within each fresh protected-boundary check. Its phase-binding descriptor is a foundation; the shared serving frame remains pending.

The active path follows the A.L.I.C.E. Stage G–J successor design. The old Phase 2 runtime is void as an implementation basis for this demo. It was removed from `main`; the historical work remains in [commit `aad9ad4`](https://github.com/NIne-WIngEd/FloRA/tree/aad9ad46bd0def74755728ed967d5a003f66e93b). Passing tests there never qualified this experiment.

The [alignment and build map](docs/FloRA_ALIGNMENT.md) names the selected planes, what can be built independently, and the evidence required. For the portions exercised by the claim, we use the same logical contracts **and physical engines** chosen for the full system. We will not substitute a convenient local database and count its result as proof for XTDB, KurrentDB, Qdrant, or any other selected engine.

## What is implemented here

- `selected/object_store.py` starts the encrypted, content-addressed raw object plane. It keeps host-held keys out of stored objects, confines deduplication to the host and encryption domain, and verifies ciphertext on reads. The local placement implements an opaque object backend; S3-compatible placement, key custody, lifecycle deletion, and backend qualification are still open.
- `selected/experience.py` maps A.L.I.C.E.'s metadata-only Experience envelope to a scoped KurrentDB stream with expected-revision writes, deterministic event IDs, and verified replay. The Docker integration gate now exercises this against KurrentDB 26.1.1, including retry behavior, stale-revision rejection, replay, and persistence across a service restart.
- `selected/edge_ingress.py` buffers metadata-only device events in a host-scoped NATS JetStream stream and acknowledges delivery only after replay or an expected-revision KurrentDB commit. A pending event survived a real NATS restart in the selected-backend gate. Device-clock conflicts and multi-device reconciliation remain open.
- `selected/claims.py` places validated A.L.I.C.E. claim identities, immutable evidence relations and versions, and current projections in XTDB v2. A committed version must cite its exact KurrentDB Experience source; current projection writes check the expected head. The Docker gate exercises valid-time correction reads, cross-host isolation, concurrent immutable writes, and restart persistence.
- `selected/formation_registry.py` persists immutable source metadata and encrypted raw-object references in XTDB, bound to actual KurrentDB commit time. `selected/formation_context.py` uses the current A.L.I.C.E. MFM source registry, custody, context assembler and input receipts, including original-evidence closure and current permission checks. `selected/formation_recollection.py` connects exact Claims, Qdrant and LadybugDB candidates to that boundary through independently registered queries. These [registered MFM interfaces](docs/REGISTERED_FORMATION.md) provide no weights, learned relevance, semantic embeddings or accepted memory. The earlier `formation_input.py` remains a primitive replay manifest helper; it is not the current MFM inference entry point. `selected/formation_gate.py` leaves proposals for independent adjudication.
- `selected/formation_policy.py` persists scoped source-use decisions in XTDB after a real Kurrent request and independently verified authorization. A revoked parent blocks later formation reads, including after recreation; retrying an older grant cannot revive it. The owner verifier has a separate signature domain for this action. This is a source-use barrier, not raw erasure or complete influence removal.
- `selected/formation_candidates.py` stores externally supplied MFM proposal bundles and independently resolved canonical proposed values with exact input/output lineage, encrypted custody and immutable XTDB registration. It recovers after an append-before-index interruption and reopens authorized sources on read. A stored proposal remains a candidate; the expected model digest is a declaration awaiting external artifact qualification.
- `selected/artifact_registry.py` provides [artifact admission and runtime references](docs/ARTIFACT_ADMISSION.md). It verifies checkpoint bytes and an independently checked external qualification receipt, persists encrypted receipt custody, and serializes role generations in XTDB. It never loads or invokes a model. The actual MFM and personality export/qualification adapters await their owning workstreams.
- `selected/source_native.py` reads exact evidence for an active current claim across XTDB, KurrentDB, and the encrypted object plane. It checks host scope, relation targets, replayed event IDs, and raw content digests; a caller must still decide whether it is authorized to expose plaintext to a model.
- `selected/decision_outcome.py` records a supplied verdict with verified source event IDs and an encrypted payload, then links a later independently sourced outcome observation to that decision in KurrentDB. It records lineage; it does not qualify the producer, judge correctness, or automatically revise personal state.
- `selected/vector_recollection.py` indexes a source-verified current claim in Qdrant by host and embedding generation. Query results are candidates checked against XTDB; reconciliation removes obsolete or unbound points after a correction. The read-time check remains necessary while cleanup lags. Synthetic vectors test the selected engine and authority filter, not semantic retrieval quality.
- `selected/graph_recollection.py` projects exact claim-to-evidence edges into host-local LadybugDB. Graph hits are checked against current XTDB claims and original KurrentDB/raw evidence. Corrections and quarantine invalidate stale hits before index cleanup. This is one evidence view, not a learned semantic or causal graph.
- `selected/episodes.py` registers externally supplied episode candidates with encrypted summary and content, exact Experience and current Claim sources, and a serialized XTDB candidate head. Source correction invalidates a candidate read. It does not segment events, write an accepted episode, or stand in for the MFM.
- `selected/personal_state.py` registers [evidence-bound host, relationship, and assistant-self candidates](docs/PERSONAL_STATE_CANDIDATES.md) using the selected XTDB plane and A.L.I.C.E.'s `ProjectionVersion` contract. It stores private content in the encrypted object plane, serializes revisions, and rechecks source freshness. A separate activation head requires an exact Experience approval and a trusted verifier; the production authentication and policy adapter is still open. It does not infer state or use it for judgment.
- `selected/outcome_revision.py` links a proposed personal-state revision to an exact decision and later observed outcome in KurrentDB. The old active state remains active until a separate approval. This checks causal lineage, not outcome quality or learned updating.
- `selected/context.py` [assembles local context and records delivery](docs/CONTEXT_DELIVERY.md) from current claims, approved personal state, and optional Qdrant candidates. It checks a trusted local use policy and binds a supplied verdict to an encrypted Experience receipt of the exact versions and sources delivered. The explicit route plan is not learned relevance or proof that a model attended to its input.
- `selected/revocation.py` applies an [immediate source-use quarantine](docs/REVOCATION_BARRIER.md) after an exact authorized deletion request. XTDB marks the current claim pending, Qdrant points are pruned, and source-dependent personal state and context fail closed. Raw erasure and cross-layer influence removal remain separate work.
- `selected/derived_reconciliation.py` uses Temporal activities to retry exact-head cleanup of Qdrant and LadybugDB projections. A completed activity is retained when the next plane retries. It does not establish full deletion or persistence across a Temporal server restart.
- The [persistent Temporal restart gate](docs/TEMPORAL_PERSISTENCE.md) uses the actual server with PostgreSQL history/visibility storage. Its selected-backend probe passed across worker, server and database restarts, retaining completed activity history and resuming pending work without repeating the completed activity. This verifies the synthetic probe's orchestration continuity; complete application recovery remains separate.
- `selected/owner_authorization.py` verifies host-bound Ed25519 action signatures against a separately enrolled public key for state activation and claim quarantine. The selected-backend quarantine gate exercises a real signature; secure key enrollment, custody, recovery, and owner policy remain product work.
- Synthetic component tests and real-backend integration tests cover these boundaries. They are infrastructure evidence, not a Fable capability or behavioral result.

The broader product backlog includes secure owner-key enrollment, complete conflict/deletion lineage, multi-device reconciliation, learned episode formation and graph relations, qualified semantic/vector retrieval and wider source retrieval, an adaptive Context Planner, production personal-state approval policy and learned updates, outcome quality assessment, and complete application recovery. For this prototype, close the actual frozen-phase/callback ownership boundary and validate a complete current-source synthetic causal pipeline under the unchanged budgets. Expand a surface only for a named experiment case. Personality and MFM are built in other chats and plugged into these interfaces when qualified. See the [alignment map](docs/FloRA_ALIGNMENT.md) for the exercised boundary.

## Dependencies and evidence gates

1. Build and verify the selected raw/event/claim authority path: encrypted objects, KurrentDB Experience, XTDB v2 Claims, and deterministic gate. Link each accepted claim to its exact source and preserve corrections, bitemporal queries, and deletion lineage.
2. Build the episode, graph, vector, source-native, context selection, host/relationship/self, and outcome paths needed for the chosen decision. Use the selected engines and record what evidence the judgment actually consumed.
3. Connect learned MFM formation and the separately qualified personality model. Neither is implemented by a hand-written stand-in in this repository.
4. Freeze synthetic histories and held-out decisions. Compare relevant and irrelevant judgment changes against a strong comparator with equal evidence, and test replay, isolation, latency, correction, and deletion. This is an experiment, not customer traction.
5. After that claim holds, have a small FBM rebuild the qualified slice for a second consenting or fictional host and test transfer across hosts.

The component checks run with Python 3.11+, `cryptography`, `kurrentdbclient~=1.3`, and A.L.I.C.E.'s product-neutral scope and formation contracts from `research/mfm-foundation-20260923@4f287a488bc908bd04f99255ee01b794bacba50b` (formation schema 1.2.0):

```bash
export PYTHONPATH=../ALICE/src:src
for test_file in tests/test_*.py; do
  python -m unittest discover -s tests -p "${test_file##*/}" -v || exit 1
done
```

Use synthetic data only. A repeatable Docker environment for the first selected backends now lives in `compose.integration.yml`. The GitHub Actions gate starts real KurrentDB, XTDB, NATS JetStream, and Qdrant services, runs the integration tests, restarts the authority services, verifies persistence, captures logs, and tears the stack down. For local use:

```bash
python -m pip install -e '.[backends,providers,embeddings]'
docker compose -f compose.integration.yml up -d
PYTHONPATH=../ALICE/src:src python -m unittest discover -s tests/integration -v
docker compose -f compose.integration.yml down -v
```

The workflow pins the A.L.I.C.E. contract checkout used by this demo. Do not substitute Phase 2 or a convenience database for the selected path.
